# Rock Paper Scissors Game - Python Mini Project

A classic Rock Paper Scissors game, upgraded with exciting features to make it even more fun and engaging!  
This project is part of my data science journey, combining creativity with Python logic.

## Key Features

- 🎮 Multiple game modes : Play against the computer or challenge a friend in Player vs Player mode.
- 
- 🎯 Set Your Own Goals : Define a maximum points limit to decide the game's length.
- 
- 🏆 Live Scoreboard : Track scores after every round and see who dominates the game.
- 
- 🕵‍♂ Secret Moves : In Player vs Player mode, inputs are hidden using getpass(), making it more exciting.
- 
- ♻  Replay Without Reset : Instantly replay the game without restarting everything.


## What I Learned

- Building interactive CLI games with Python.

- Implementing getpass() for hidden input handling.

- Managing game loops, player inputs, and scoring systems.

- Structured a clean, professional mini-project ready for GitHub and real-world portfolios.
